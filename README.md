# scripts

A collection of items written in Ruby and Python. This repository started out as a collection of solutions created during the [ChicagoRuby hack night](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRuby/) and other items were mixed in with it. Each folder is a separate script and has its own readme with more information.
